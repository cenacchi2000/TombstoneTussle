Tombstone Tussle

The TOMBSTONE TUSSLE is a maze game that allows players to freely explore the maze and customize their own roles and maps.

The theme is about human policemen trying to search the graveyard and kill all the zombies, and as the zombie side, the player needs to defend himself. During the resistance, the zombies need to dodge the police bullets and utilize their power-ups to gain an advantage for themselves, approaching and eliminating all the policemen in order to reach the victory of the game.

Your ultimate objective: eliminate all the policemen and secure victory for the undead. Will you rise as the triumphant zombies or succumb to the relentless forces of law and order?
